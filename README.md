This is the GitHub for the Python module OwOpy!
This module OwOifies your sentence better than any other.

By "OwOifies your sentence" I mean it turns your sentence into japanese "furry" baby babblespeak :>

It has 1 function - owoify(string).

Note that python 3.6 or above is required due to the use of F-strings in the source code.

Enjoy using it :>
