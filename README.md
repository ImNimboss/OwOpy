This is the GitHub for the Python module OwOpy!
This module OwOifies your sentence better than any other.
Available in both synchronous (normal) form and asynchronous (async/await syntax) form.

It has 2 functions - owoify('example_string') and aio_owoify('example_string').
The aio_owoify must be used in async form to prevent errors.

If you do not know the difference between sync and async, it is recommended to use the normal owoify() (synced function) as it is the most basic and is used for 
most programs and applications.

Enjoy using it ðŸ’»
