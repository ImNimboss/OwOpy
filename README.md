This is the GitHub for the Python module OwOpy!
This module OwOifies your sentence better than any other.

Installation -
```pip3 install git+https://github.com/ImNimboss/OwOpy.git#egg=owopy```

This module has no dependencies, it only uses one python default package's function - [random.choice](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice).

By "OwOifies your sentence" I mean it turns your sentence into japanese "furry" baby babblespeak :>

It has 1 function - owoify(string).

Note that [python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) or above is required due to the use of f-strings in the source code.

Enjoy using it :>
